#### Anonymous practice interviews

- [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/) - Very high bar, they're always DP problems. People are also pretty harsh, morale takes a hit but at least it's humbling. Well-polished, gives you a chance to connect after if you both want to.
- [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com) - Low bar, friendly people. 
- [RefDash](https://refdash.com/)
- [Gainlo](http://www.gainlo.co/) - charges money, what a rip-off
